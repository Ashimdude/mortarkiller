OUTDATED TOOL
USE https://github.com/Ashimdude/mortarkiller_desktop instead
better and faster



The app is hosted at https://mortarkiller.streamlit.app/

Or you can run it locally by downloading/cloning the repo
and for that you need to pip install the things in requirements.txt
as well as do "pip install streamlit"
and "pip install pillow"

Use it by pasting an unzoomed screenshot of pubg map with your target marked.
next, hold click on the image as if you are using the line tool in paint.
Draw an invisible line from yourself to your target, try to be precise with the pixels.
Adjust relative-to-terrain height of yourself or target
There are independent inputs for sea level altitude as well. You can obtain that in-game using glider/parachute altimiter
or with the in-development system of contextual tips in the app.
